## This is a repo to learn basic implementation of data structure and algorithm with C

I intend to use this for educational purpose only, feel free to use this code if you need. 
I also want to make a template for competitive programming in C, then these implementations are actually very useful. Of course I'm still mainly updating this repo.
It is not finished yet,and I expected it won't be until the end of December 2022.
